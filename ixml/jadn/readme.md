Everything here is very much work in progress!

to do
- convert and test EBNF as iXML

ideas

- parse JAS in iXML
  - convert to JADN
  - convert to docs (emulate XSLX pathway)
  - convert to Metaschema?
    - since Metaschema is weaker, this might be possible?
    - or at least we can determine where and where not
    - at any rate, to schema syntaxes
    - constraint sets etc etc
